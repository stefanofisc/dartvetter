  ### 1. Remove NaN from (TIME, SAP_FLUX) data
  ### 2. Concatenate data from the first year in which the target star has been observed
  ### 3. The Lightkurve stitch() method normalize each light curve by default. This means that you have to normalize 
        light curve data from each sector 
  ### 4. Remove outliers
  ### 5. Create the transit mask and flatten the light curve
  ### 6. Fold the light curve over a given period and epoch
  ### 7. Bin the phase folded signal
  ### 8. Fix the length of the binned phase folded signal
