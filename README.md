### Background
DART-Vetter is a Convolutional Neural Network trained on Kepler and TESS Threshold Crossing Events (TCEs). The model is designed to distinguish planetary candidates from false positives detected in any transiting survey.

### Citation
The paper detailing the model architecture and most recent applications on TESS candidates is in preparation. We planned to submit the manuscript to The Astrophysical Journal.
