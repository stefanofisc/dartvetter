### Background
DART-Vetter is a Convolutional Neural Network trained on Kepler and TESS Threshold Crossing Events (TCEs). The model is designed to distinguish planetary candidates from false positives detected in any transiting survey.

### Citation
The paper detailing the model architecture and most recent applications on TESS candidates is in preparation. We planned to submit the manuscript to The Astrophysical Journal.

### Code
This section provides an overview on the content of each directory
- TFRecord: methods for creating and visualizing the samples of TFRecord files;
     - tfrecord_data: TFRecord files used to train the model;
- cnn: several methods to build different network architectures;
- preprocessing: a set of files developed to pre-process light curves. The main file is generate_input_records.py and it is used to produce the global view for each TCE. Since this pre-processing pipeline deal with a huge volumen of data (i.e. TCEs), the workload has been distributed on different nodes. We provide the tess256core.slurm file to allow the user to run the generate_input_records.py file in parallel;
- tce_csv_catalogs: we provide all the TCE csv catalogs used in this work;
- training: methods for model training and assessment;
    - trained_models/dartvetter: checkpoint files to load our best model. Build the model and load the optimized weights contained in this file if you do not want to run the training procedure;
